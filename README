I'm working on a weather application that allows users to check the current weather conditions for a specific city or their current location. It's a simple web-based tool with a clean interface.

You can search for a city, and it will display details like temperature, weather description, humidity, wind speed, and more. The temperatures are shown in both Celsius and Fahrenheit, and you can switch between them by clicking on the temperature unit.
